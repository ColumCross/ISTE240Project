		<h1>History of the Land</h1>
		<div class="content first">
			<h1>Kirker's Discovery</h1>
			<p>It is a family legend that the Kirkers and the Services made their way down the St. Lawrence on a raft. However, it is more likely that they used a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bateau">bateau</a>, a type of boat traders used and voyageurs used. They received a <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/environment-and-energy/crown-patents">Crown Patent</a> for the land they stopped at. They started farming this land around the mid-1800s until the turn of the century when a man by the name of <a href="family.shtml">Benjamin Kirker Jr.</a> traded some of the farmland with James "Jimmie" Wallace for a parcel of land next to the St. Lawrence River.</p>

		<div class="content second">
			<h1>Current Location</h1>
			<p>Ben wanted to start a boat building business. <a href="building.shtml">He built a barn to act as his boat works.</a> Sadly, he never made a go of the boat building business, and the barn was transformed into the current Lower Cottage.</p>
