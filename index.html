			<h1>NOTE</h1>
			<p>This website does not function as intended as the location it is currently hosted (GitHub) does not support the use of Server-Side Includes (SSIs). A major requirement for the project was the use of SSIs, and therefore a large portion of the website (most notably the navigation bar) requires the use of SSIs.</p>
			<p>This project has been uploaded as is, and I have no intention of updating the project to work without SSIs. The purpose of me uploading this project was to show the work I created at the time for class.</p>

			<h1>Intro</h1>
			<p>Before I was one year old, I was crossing international borders. The first and most influential place I went to was my cottage on the Canadian side of the 1000 Islands. "The Cottage," as I refer to it, has been in my father's side of the family for generations. The Cottage is located on Kirker Point, Ontario, Canada. The land first came into my family's ownership by my Great-Great-Grandfather Benjamin Kirker Jr. and was then broken up into 5 parts throughout the years.</p>

			<h1>The Cottage</h1>
			<p>The Cottage is composed of two buildings: The "Lower Cottage," which was originally a boat workshop first built in the early 1900's, and is used by my Aunt and Uncle, and their immediate family; and the "Upper Cottage," the "modern" building built by my grandfather in 1984. The Upper Cottage is used by my father and my immediate family. Both cottages belong jointly to my family.</p>

			<h1>Brief History</h1>
			<p>My Great-Great-Grandfather Benjamin Kirker Jr. traded for the land where the Cottage is now with farmland his grandparents "discovered" when they floated down the St. Lawrence River on a raft. They hold a Crown Patent for that land, meaning they were the first Europeans to farm the land.</p>
