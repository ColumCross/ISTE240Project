When my Grandfather was a boy, sometimes Arthur’s chauffeur would drive him, his mother, and others in the family up in Arthur’s big car, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmon_Motor_Car_Company">Marmon.</a> The trip was a day long affair during which they stopped for a picnic lunch and took the ferry from Alex Bay to Rockport.</p><span id="nettie"></span>
